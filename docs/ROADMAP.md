## v2.2.0 - Sentiment-Adaptive NPCs (Grok Suggestion)

**Feature**: Real-time player sentiment analysis to adapt NPC behavior

### How It Works

```
Player Chat/Actions → Sentiment Analysis (Grok) → Behavior Modifier → NPC Response
```

### Implementation

1. **Sentiment Detection Layer**
   - Analyze player messages for frustration, excitement, confusion
   - Track behavioral patterns (repeated deaths, idle time, exploration)
   - Use Grok's real-time analysis capabilities

2. **Adaptive Response System**
   ```yaml
   sentiment_adaptation:
     enabled: true
     provider: "grok"  # Best for real-time analysis

     behaviors:
       frustrated:
         - offer_hints: true
         - tone: "encouraging"
         - suggest_break: "after_5_deaths"

       excited:
         - match_energy: true
         - offer_challenges: true

       confused:
         - simplify_language: true
         - offer_tutorial: true

       bored:
         - suggest_quests: true
         - introduce_mystery: true
   ```

3. **NPC Personality Modulation**
   - Base personality + sentiment modifier
   - "Guard" becomes more helpful when player is lost
   - "Merchant" offers discounts when player is frustrated

### API Integration

```java
// SentimentAnalyzer.java
public class SentimentAnalyzer {
    private final GrokClient grok;

    public PlayerSentiment analyze(Player player) {
        // Recent chat messages
        List<String> messages = getRecentMessages(player, 10);

        // Behavioral signals
        int recentDeaths = getDeaths(player, Duration.ofMinutes(5));
        boolean isIdle = isPlayerIdle(player);

        return grok.analyzeSentiment(messages, recentDeaths, isIdle);
    }
}
```

## v2.3.0 - Neural Dream Weaving (Grok Collab)

**Feature**: EEG/biosignal integration to weave player consciousness into gameplay

> "Turn your daydreams into custom quests or biomes" - @grok

### Concept

```
Player Biosignals (EEG/Wearables) → Neural Pattern Analysis → World Generation
```

### Implementation Ideas

1. **Biosignal Input Sources**
   - Muse headband (EEG)
   - Apple Watch / Fitbit (heart rate, stress)
   - Empatica E4 (electrodermal activity)

2. **Dream Weaving Engine**
   ```yaml
   neural_weaving:
     enabled: true
     inputs:
       - eeg_alpha_waves    # Relaxation state
       - heart_rate_variance # Stress indicator
       - skin_conductance   # Emotional arousal

     world_responses:
       high_stress:
         - spawn_calming_biome: "cherry_grove"
         - reduce_mob_spawns: 50%
         - ambient_music: "peaceful"

       creative_flow:
         - generate_quest: "from_subconscious"
         - unlock_hidden_area: true

       daydreaming:
         - morph_terrain: "dream_logic"
         - npc_speaks_in_riddles: true
   ```

3. **Adaptive World Healing**
   - Frustrated player → world becomes gentler
   - Calm player → world offers challenges
   - Creative state → procedural content generation
